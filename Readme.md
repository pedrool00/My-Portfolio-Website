This is my personal portfolio website, designed to simplify the analysis of my skills and certifications. It serves as a unified interface, allowing easy access to all my social sites from one stylish and user-friendly location. Built with React, the website features a dynamic and responsive design that adapts to any screen size.

## Features

- Dynamic Website using React (utilizing components and hooks)
- Built from scratch
- Very simple, yet stylish, customizable, and easy to navigate design
- Responsive and User Friendly - Adjusts to fit every screen size

## Components

- **Header**: Connects to every section of the site with one single click, and contains links to my socials. It disappears when scrolling down and reappears when scrolling up.
- **ColorSwap buttons**: Easily swap the theme of the site with just one click. The buttons are located at the top and bottom of the page to change the first and last components, offering four different designs to choose from.
- **Landing Section**: A brief description of myself, serving as an introduction to the site.
- **Skills Section**: A visual and easy-to-read representation of the skills I currently have, making it easy for employers to identify my expertise.
